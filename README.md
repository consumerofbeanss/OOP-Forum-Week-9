### A large company with locations in different cities has taken an OOP approach in creating an administration program that manages all aspects of its business. These aspects include:
- the sale of all the different products that the company manages
- the salaries for managers, office staff and sales personnel.

#### (a) By making use of an example from the above scenario, distinguish between a class and an instantiation of a class. (3 points)
##### A class is a template/blueprint for an object in java, which is the instantiation of a class. For example, managers, office staff, and sales personnel are classes which have properties like names and salaries. In this case, an object would be an instance of a class and contains a certain value for their names and salaries.
